- `KANBAN.md` - Current development status and priorities
- `CARS_COLLECTION_COMPLETION.md` - Cars workflow completion status
- Workflow documentation in `.claude/`

**Analysis Tasks:**
1. Extract all business rules and constraints
2. Map user stories to implemented features
3. Identify business logic gaps
4. Validate workflow state transitions
5. Check for conflicting rules
6. Assess workflow completeness

**Output:**
```json

## Implementation Strategy

### Using Claude Code Task Tool

Each agent can be invoked as a specialized Task agent:

```typescript
// Agent 1: Business Logic Analyzer
Task({
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  description: "Analyze business logic",
  prompt: `
    Analyze DirectApp business logic using:
    - GUMPEN_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md
    - USER_STORIES_COLLECTION_MAPPING.md
    - KANBAN.md

    Extract:
    1. All business rules
    2. User story coverage
    3. Logic gaps

    Output JSON with findings and recommendations.
  `
})

// Agent 2: Schema Design Auditor
Task({
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  description: "Audit schema design",
  prompt: `
    Audit DirectApp schema using:
    - SCHEMA_ANALYSIS.md
    - ALL_COLLECTIONS_OPTIMIZATION_COMPLETE.md
    - MCP schema tool

    Evaluate:
    1. Collection structure
    2. Field types and constraints
    3. Naming conventions

    Output JSON with design scores and issues.
  `
})

// Continue for agents 3-6...
```

### Using Slash Commands

Create custom slash commands in `.claude/commands/`:

**`.claude/commands/analyze-business-logic.md`**
```markdown
---
name: analyze-business-logic
description: Run Agent 1 - Business Logic Analyzer
---

You are Agent 1 in the Multi-Agent Orchestration System.

Analyze DirectApp business logic:
1. Read GUMPEN_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md
2. Read USER_STORIES_COLLECTION_MAPPING.md
3. Read KANBAN.md
4. Extract all business rules
5. Map user stories to features
6. Identify gaps
7. Output findings in JSON format

Focus on workflow validation, state transitions, and business constraints.
```

**`.claude/commands/analyze-schema.md`**
```markdown
---
name: analyze-schema
description: Run Agent 2 - Schema Design Auditor
---

You are Agent 2 in the Multi-Agent Orchestration System.

Audit DirectApp schema design:
1. Read SCHEMA_ANALYSIS.md
2. Query schema via MCP tools
3. Evaluate collection structure
4. Check field types and constraints
5. Assess naming conventions
6. Identify performance issues
7. Output audit results in JSON format

Focus on design philosophy, consistency, and maintainability.
