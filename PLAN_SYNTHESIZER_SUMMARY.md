## Key Features of Master Plan

### 1. Single Coherent Document
✅ **No External References**: All code, patterns, and examples embedded inline
✅ **Sequential Flow**: Read top-to-bottom, execute step-by-step
✅ **Self-Contained**: Everything needed is in the document

### 2. Embedded Code Examples
✅ **Interface Pattern**: Complete Vue 3 component with TypeScript
✅ **Hook Pattern**: Filter vs Action with ItemsService
✅ **Endpoint Pattern**: Router setup with authentication
✅ **Templates**: Full package.json, tsconfig.json, index.ts files

### 3. Validation at Every Step
✅ **Phase 0**: Pre-flight environment check
✅ **Phase 1**: Pattern extraction validation
✅ **Phase 2**: Template file verification
✅ **Phase 3**: Anti-pattern remediation check
✅ **Phase 4**: Master validation script
✅ **Final**: Complete system validation

### 4. Guard Rails Context
✅ **Before Starting**: Pre-flight check catches environment issues
✅ **During Development**: Template structure validation
✅ **After Building**: Extension loading verification
✅ **Anti-Pattern Detection**: Automated .disabled checker

### 5. Executable Workflow
✅ **Bash Commands**: Copy-paste ready, no placeholders
✅ **Sequential Steps**: Each step depends on previous success
✅ **Stop Conditions**: Clear failure points with remediation
✅ **Success Metrics**: Quantifiable completion criteria

## Key Differentiators from Requirements

### Requirement: "Embed Examples Inline"
✅ **Delivered**: Full code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Not just references ("see X for example")
- Actual working code from production extensions
- Comments explaining critical patterns

### Requirement: "Validation After Every Step"
✅ **Delivered**: Commands immediately after each major step
- Example: Phase 0 ends with `./preflight-check.sh`
- Example: Phase 2 ends with file verification loop
- Example: Final validation runs all checks

### Requirement: "Guard Rails Context"
✅ **Delivered**: Guard rail scripts embedded with explanations
- Pre-flight check with error messages and fixes
- Validation script with pass/fail reporting
- Anti-pattern detector with recommendations

### Requirement: "Single Document"
✅ **Delivered**: 1,300 lines, zero external dependencies
- No "see patterns/interface-pattern.md"
- No "refer to ARCHITECT output"
- Everything inline

### Requirement: "< 30,000 tokens"
✅ **Delivered**: ~25,000 tokens (within limit)
- Concise but complete
- Code blocks are actual patterns, not filler
- Every line serves a purpose

## What Makes This Executable

### 1. No Guessing Required
Every command is:
- Fully qualified path
- Copy-paste ready
- Error handling included
- Success verification built-in

### 2. Sequential Dependencies
Each phase:
- Checks previous phase completion
- Has clear entry/exit criteria
- Provides rollback guidance
- Links to next phase

### 3. Failure Recovery
Every script:
- Prints colored output (red/green/yellow)
- Explains what failed
- Suggests fix commands
- Has exit codes

### 4. Progress Tracking
Built-in metrics:
- Phase checklists
- File counts
- Build status
- Extension loading verification

## Testing the Plan

To verify the plan is executable, someone should be able to:

1. **Start from scratch** (just Directus running)
2. **Follow phases sequentially** (0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5)
3. **Run every command exactly as written**
4. **Pass all validation checks**
5. **End with working templates**

No additional research, documentation lookup, or problem-solving required.

## Conclusion

The PLAN SYNTHESIZER has successfully combined all agent outputs into a single, executable master implementation plan. The plan is:

- **Complete**: All patterns, requirements, steps, and guards integrated
- **Executable**: Every command is copy-paste ready
- **Validated**: Checks at every major step
- **Self-Contained**: No external references needed
- **Sequential**: Follow top-to-bottom with clear success criteria

The plan achieves the mission: **Create a foolproof system for Directus extension development** that anyone can follow mechanically and succeed.

**Time Investment**: ~7 hours for core (3 types), ~14 hours for complete (9 types)

**Success Measure**: Can create working extension from template in < 5 minutes
