# Methodology Alignment: .claude + .github Refactor

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Impact:** Critical - CI/CD now enforces pattern-first development

---

## Summary

Refactored `.claude` commands and `.github` workflows to align with the project's development methodology: **Organized > Complex**, **Machine→Intelligence**, and **Pattern-First Development**.

---

## Changes Overview

### 1. GitHub Workflow Enhancements

#### New Jobs Added

**validate-patterns (NEW)**
- Validates extension structure (package.json, src/index.ts)
- Checks Directus config in package.json
- Enforces naming conventions (lowercase-with-hyphens)
- Detects anti-patterns:
  - Committed node_modules (prevents 195MB+ bloat)
  - .disabled extensions without archiving
  - Custom monorepo infrastructure
- **Impact:** Zero tolerance for pattern violations - builds fail if patterns broken

**health-monitor (NEW)**
- Calculates workflow health score (0-100%)
- Tracks successful vs failed jobs
- Determines health tier (EXCELLENT/GOOD/FAIR/POOR)
- Records metrics in JSON for analytics
- Alerts on degraded health (<75%)
- **Impact:** Proactive monitoring of CI/CD pipeline health

#### Updated Jobs

**deploy-staging**
- Added analytics recording (deployment events)
- Enhanced health checks (server + extensions validation)
- Conditional Dokploy trigger (graceful if not configured)
- Environment structured with name + URL
- **Impact:** Better deployment visibility and tracking

**deploy-production**
- Same enhancements as staging
- Manual approval workflow enforced
- Deployment type tracking ("manual")
- **Impact:** Production deployments now fully auditable

**report**
- Enhanced summary with health score
- Added duration estimates per job
- Commands integration section
- Development methodology explanation
- **Impact:** Better visibility into CI/CD status

#### Fixed Issues

- ✅ Environment configuration (staging/production properly structured)
- ✅ Secret access warnings (conditional checks added)
- ✅ Job dependencies (pattern validation integrated)

### 2. New Commands Created

#### `/core:deploy`
**Location:** `.claude/commands/core/deploy.md`

**What it does:**
- Triggers deployment to staging or production
- Pre-deployment validation (pattern checks, uncommitted changes)
- Records deployment events in analytics
- Health monitoring (30s staging, 45s production)
- Integration with GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch

**Usage:**
```bash
/core:deploy staging
/core:deploy production
/core:deploy production --skip-checks  # Not recommended
```

**Philosophy alignment:**
- Machine phase: Validation, deployment trigger, health checks
- Intelligence phase: Deployment summary, recommendations, next steps

#### `/advanced:workflow-health`
**Location:** `.claude/commands/advanced/workflow-health.md`

**What it does:**
- Monitors GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Fetches workflow runs from GitHub API
- Calculates success rate, duration trends
- Pattern validation statistics
- Deployment analytics (frequency, success rate)
- Failure pattern analysis

**Usage:**
```bash
/advanced:workflow-health
/advanced:workflow-health --detailed --last-n=50
```

**Metrics tracked:**
- Workflow success rate
- Average build duration
- Failure points (which jobs fail most)
- Pattern compliance rate
- Deployment frequency

### 3. Updated Commands

#### `/core:done`
**Location:** `.claude/commands/core/done.md`

**Changes:**
- Added CI/CD integration section
- Monitors GitHub Actions workflow after PR creation
- Reports build status in real-time
- Shows pattern validation results
- Tracks deployment readiness
- Records CI/CD metrics in analytics

**New output sections:**
```
🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Status:
✓ Build Extensions (1m 23s)
✓ Pattern Validation (32s) - No violations
✓ Integration Tests (3m 45s)
⏳ Deploy to Staging - Queued (on merge to main)
```

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### RUNBOOK.md
**Location:** `.claude/RUNBOOK.md`

**New section: "CI/CD INTEGRATION (Pattern-First Development)"**

Covers:
- GitHub Actions workflow structure
- Pattern validation details
- Health monitoring system
- Commands integration
- Deployment flow integration
- Analytics integration (SQL queries)
- Environment configuration
- Philosophy integration

**Impact:** Developers now understand how commands connect to CI/CD

---

## Methodology Alignment

### Before Refactor

**Misalignments:**
- ❌ Commands organized, but CI/CD was manual job structure
- ❌ No pattern validation in CI/CD
- ❌ No health monitoring
- ❌ No analytics integration
- ❌ Deployment not connected to command workflow
- ❌ Environment configuration incomplete

### After Refactor

**Aligned:**
- ✅ Commands trigger and monitor CI/CD workflows
- ✅ Pattern-first development enforced in CI/CD
- ✅ Health monitoring with score calculation
- ✅ Analytics integrated (deployments, workflow runs, patterns)
- ✅ Deployment connected to /core:done and /core:deploy
- ✅ Environment configuration complete

---

## Philosophy Integration

### Machine→Intelligence

**Machine (Deterministic Scripts):**
- Pattern validation (structural checks, naming conventions)
- Health score calculation (success rate, duration)
- Deployment triggers (GitHub Actions API)
- Analytics recording (JSON/SQLite)

**Intelligence (LLM Analysis):**
- Health assessment (trend analysis, recommendations)
- Failure pattern analysis (identify root causes)
- Deployment summaries (impact, warnings)
- Improvement suggestions (optimization opportunities)

### Pattern-First Development

**Enforced in CI/CD:**
- Official Directus extension patterns (package.json + src/index.ts)
- Anti-pattern detection (no node_modules, no monorepo)
- Zero tolerance policy (build fails on violation)
- 95% confidence from official docs

**Tracked in Analytics:**
- Pattern violations caught
- Anti-patterns prevented
- Extension compliance rate
- Naming violations

### Continuous Improvement

**Health Monitoring:**
- Workflow health score (0-100%)
- Success rate tracking
- Failure pattern identification
- Degradation alerts

**Analytics-Driven:**
- Deployment frequency
- Success rate trends
- Build duration optimization
- Preventive measures
