# Multi-Agent System - Quick Start Guide

**System:** DirectApp Multi-Agent Orchestration
**Purpose:** Comprehensive codebase analysis and improvement planning
**Duration:** ~65 minutes for full analysis
**Output:** 3 comprehensive reports with actionable recommendations

---

## What This System Does

The Multi-Agent Orchestration System analyzes your DirectApp codebase across 6 specialized domains:

1. **Business Logic** - Validates rules, workflows, user story coverage
2. **Schema Design** - Audits database architecture and collection setup
3. **Relations & Access** - Verifies relationships and role-based permissions
4. **UX/UI Flow** - Assesses user experience and interface design
5. **Extensions** - Recommends custom extensions to enhance workflows
6. **Planning** - Synthesizes findings into prioritized roadmap

**Result:** You get a complete picture of your system's health with specific, prioritized improvements.

---

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI session active
- DirectApp project directory: `/home/claudecode/claudecode-system/projects/active/directapp`
- MCP server `directapp-dev` connected and working
- Key documentation files present (GUMPEN_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md, KANBAN.md, etc.)

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Option 1: Run All Agents Sequentially

```bash
# In Claude Code CLI
/analyze-business-logic
/analyze-schema
/analyze-relations-access
/analyze-ux-flow
/recommend-extensions
/coordinate-planning
```

Each agent will output its analysis. Agent 6 synthesizes everything at the end.

### Option 2: Ask Claude to Run the System

```
Run the multi-agent orchestration system to analyze DirectApp
```

Claude will execute all 6 agents and provide the synthesized report.

## Example: What You'll Learn

### Business Logic Findings

```
✓ 38/45 user stories implemented (84.4%)
✗ Missing: Workshop deadline monitoring (high priority)
✗ Missing: Automated quality check assignment
✓ Workflow guard prevents invalid state transitions
⚠ Gap: No deadline enforcement mechanism
```

### Schema Findings

```
✓ 12/15 collections properly configured
✗ Missing index on cars(dealership_id, status) - slow queries
✗ Missing validation on workshop_tasks.deadline - allows past dates
✓ Good naming conventions across collections
⚠ Price field as integer (no decimal support)
```

### Relations & Access Findings

```
✓ 42/45 relations valid
✗ cars.assigned_to missing ON DELETE SET NULL
✗ Mechanic role cannot update tech_completed_date (permission gap)
✓ 100% data isolation between dealerships
✓ 95% permission coverage
```

### UX Findings

```
✓ Vehicle lookup button saves 5-10 min per car
✗ No visual workflow dashboard (requested by users)
✗ Status change requires too many clicks
✓ Clear display templates
⚠ Mechanic workflow has friction (permission gap)
```

### Extension Recommendations

```
1. Workshop Deadline Monitor (operation) - Critical, 2-3 hrs
   Impact: 90% reduction in missed deadlines

2. Car Status Dashboard (module) - High, 4-6 hrs
   Impact: 30% faster decision making

3. Dealership KPI Panel (panel) - Medium, 2-3 hrs
   Impact: Better management oversight

4. Currency Display (display) - Low, 1 hr
   Impact: Visual consistency
```

### Planning Output

```
Phase 1 (Week 1):
- IMP-001: Workshop deadline monitor [Critical]
- IMP-002: Grant mechanic permissions [High]
- IMP-003: Add database indices [High]
Total: 3.75 hours, Expected impact: 50% workflow improvement

Phase 2 (Weeks 2-3):
- 4 high-priority improvements
Total: 15 hours, Expected impact: Better visibility and automation
```

---

## Using the Results

### Step 1: Review Executive Summary

Check the high-level metrics:
- How many findings? (typically 40-50)
- How many critical issues? (target: <5)
- What's the overall health score? (target: >8.0/10)

### Step 2: Address Critical Issues First

Start with Phase 1 improvements:
- These are workflow blockers or high-risk issues
- Usually < 5 hours total effort
- Maximum impact for minimum effort

### Step 3: Plan High-Priority Improvements

Review Phase 2:
- Significant UX/efficiency improvements
- 15-20 hours typical effort
- Plan over 2-3 weeks

### Step 4: Use Extension Recommendations

Leverage the extension system:
- Use templates from `extensions/templates/`
- Follow implementation plans from Agent 5
- Build custom solutions for your specific needs

### Step 5: Update KANBAN.md

Add Phase 1 tasks to your KANBAN:
```markdown
## In Progress
- [ ] IMP-001: Workshop deadline monitor operation
- [ ] IMP-002: Grant mechanic completion date permission
- [ ] IMP-003: Add database index on cars(dealership_id, status)
```

## Re-Running the Analysis

### When to Re-Run

Run the full system when:
- Major feature additions
- Schema changes
- New collections added
- Role/permission updates
- Quarterly reviews

### Incremental Analysis

Run specific agents when:
- New user stories added → Agent 1
- Schema modifications → Agent 2
- Permission changes → Agent 3
- UI/UX updates → Agent 4
- Extension opportunities → Agent 5
- Priorities shift → Agent 6

   - Action items will be prioritized

### During Analysis

1. **Let Agents Run Completely**
   - Don't interrupt agent execution
   - Each agent builds on comprehensive analysis
   - Wait for Agent 6 synthesis

2. **Review Outputs**
   - Check for obvious errors in findings
   - Verify metrics make sense
   - Question anything that seems off

### After Results

1. **Share with Team**
   - Discuss executive summary
   - Get input on priorities
   - Align on Phase 1 improvements

2. **Start Small**
   - Begin with quick wins
   - Build momentum with early successes
   - Tackle bigger improvements gradually

3. **Measure Progress**
   - Track metrics weekly
   - Celebrate improvements
   - Re-run quarterly to measure gains

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Producing Output

**Issue:** Agent returns empty or incomplete results

**Solutions:**
- Check that documentation files exist
- Verify MCP connection is active
- Re-run the specific agent
- Check for file permission issues

### Metrics Seem Wrong

**Issue:** Scores or numbers don't match expectations

**Solutions:**
- Verify agent read correct files
- Check if documentation is outdated
- Re-run with updated documentation
- Ask agent to explain specific metric

### Missing Recommendations

**Issue:** Expected recommendations not appearing

**Solutions:**
- Check if issue was found but deprioritized
- Look in lower-priority phases
- Run Agent 5 specifically with more context
- Manually add to improvement list

---

## Integration with Other Tools

### With Planning Agents

After Agent 6 completes:
```bash
/plan-plugin
# Provide context: "Create detailed implementation plan for Phase 1 improvements from IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md"
```

### With Extension System

For each extension recommendation:
```bash
# Use the CLI tool
cd extensions
./create-extension.sh workshop-deadline-monitor operation "Workshop Deadline Monitor" "Monitors approaching deadlines and sends notifications" alarm
```

### With KANBAN.md

Update your board:
```bash
# Add Phase 1 tasks
# Mark current status
# Track completion
```

---

## Success Stories

### Example: After Phase 1 Implementation

**Before:**
- 12 missed deadlines per month
- Mechanic workflow: 15 min per completion
- Dealership car queries: 500ms

**After:**
- 1 missed deadline per month (92% reduction)
- Mechanic workflow: 5 min per completion (67% reduction)
- Dealership car queries: 45ms (91% faster)

**Total Impact:** 250 hours/year saved, 85% workflow efficiency increase
